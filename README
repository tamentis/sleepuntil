NAME
     sleepuntil — sleep until a given time

SYNOPSIS
     sleepuntil timespec

DESCRIPTION
     sleepuntil is a mix of sleep(1) and at(1). It takes the same format of
     time as at(1), including "noon" or "teatime". Since it uses the parser
     from at, you can refer to the at man page for the format.

EXAMPLES
      sleepuntil noon

      sleepuntil 5:00 pm

SEE ALSO
     sleep(1), at(8),
